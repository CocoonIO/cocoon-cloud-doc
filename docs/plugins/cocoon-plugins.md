Cocoon plugins
===============

Cocoon plugins provide an elegant and minimalist API and are designed with portability in mind from the beginning. Framework dependencies are avoided by design so the plugins can run on any platform and can be integrated with any app framework or game engine.

You can install these plugins directly at the cloud using the "Cocoon" tab in the plugins section.
