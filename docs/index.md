Overview
=============

Cocoon is a set of tools to **create, accelerate, test, deploy and monetize** your HTML5 apps and games on all mobile devices with many interesting features to help you deliver great web products faster.

Performance is key to mobile web app and game development, and Cocoon was designed from the ground up to improve all aspects of HTML5 execution. Cocoon provides the best JavaScript and HTML5 execution webview engines to choose from, depending on the type of your project and the platforms you want to deploy it to.

In addition, Cocoon provides a consistent and accelerated environment to close the gap between web and native apps. You get all the benefits of a modern mobile browser while developing a native app.

As the previous image explains, you only have to create you game or app in HTML5, test it using our [developer app](/user-guide/developer-app) and use the [cloud compiler](/user-guide/project-creation) for configuring and getting your final app **already signed** and ready for upload to the stores.
