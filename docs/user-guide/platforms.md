Platforms
==================

A platform is a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed.

##Â Supported platforms

Currently the supported platforms are iOS and Android for mobile and tablet.

When a project is compiled, it will be compiled for all the available platforms.

### Signing keys

Each platform requires different configuration settings for the signing process. A user can add and remove keys from the [user profile](/user-guide/user-profile) and from the same [project configuration](/user-guide/project-configuration).

To learn more about the process and the advantages of including signing keys, you can visit the [cloud compiler](/user-guide/project-creation) section or the [user profile](/user-guide/user-profile) section.

### Icons and splashes

Icons and splashes configuration will be similar to another Cordova based project. However, each platform might require different icons size.

To learn more about how to add them to your project, you can visit the [icons and splashes](/user-guide/icons-and-splashes) section.
