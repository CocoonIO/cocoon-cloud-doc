User profile

Once you are logged in, you can access the user profile by clicking your name in the top right corner of the screen.

In the user profile, there are two main tabs: signing keys and profile.

### User plans

It will be possible to upgrade your user plan from the user profile. However, at the moment, the only available plan is the free one.

We are already working on offering different options according to the needs of each user. They will be available soon.

<!--## Delete a user account

You can delete your user account whenever you want. However, if a user account is deleted, all data linked to that account will be removed from our servers, including the projects, the source code, the compilations and, of course, the signing keys.

Please, ensure you have a copy of all the relevant data before deleting it, because it can't be recovered. -->
